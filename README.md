This application simulates the balance annually given an initial withdrawal 
rate. It accurately simulates real-life market conditions, and assumes a nominal
rate of return value of about 7.5%, and an inflation rate of 2.5%. Thus, this
application assumes a 5% real rate of return moving forward, which is lower than
the historical average of about 6.5-7%.
